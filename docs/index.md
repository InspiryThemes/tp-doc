## 🛡️ Use a Child Theme (Highly Recommended)

If you plan to make any modifications to theme files, we strongly recommend using a child theme. This ensures that your changes are preserved during theme updates. A ready-to-use child theme is included in the TourPress package you downloaded from ThemeForest.
